This repositiory is currently under construction and in the future will contain scripts used for OE33 METTL1 KO resistance project. 
There are three folders in the repository: for RNA-seq analysis (`./rna_seq`), for proteomics analysis (`./proteomics`), and for the PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) network constructiona and the key proteins identification (`./networks`).
